This notebook was created as a solution to one of the assessments while I was job hunting. The idea isn't anything groundbreaking (relax, neither are you 😄), but it's a decent, solid, and sincere step-by-step implementation, code-wise. It also includes some ideas and a discussion of the results — almost like a tutorial — so it might be useful for someone who wants to dig into the topic.
